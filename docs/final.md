Chosen Strategies & Solutions:
* Front-End:
    * HTML/CSS
    * Bulma - CSS library 
* Back-End:
    * Json Files
    * Canvas.js - Data Visualizations

Technical System Decision Rationale:
* We wanted to stick with libraries that were familiar to us such as canvas.js for visualizations,
but also wanted to experiment with new a new css library such as bulma so we could utilize features
that we had yet to utilize for a web application.

How/If Final System Helps Address Problem:
* Our web application is an attempted start towards providing data visualizations to tax payers in
Prince George's (PG) County. We hope this web application serves as an inspiration to continue providing
tax payers of PG County methods in which they can present and visualize spending data.

Challenges Faced and Final Design Impact:
* Scope of visualizations: There were many visualizations that we wanted to make up, but there were also difficulties trying to extract the correct data from the api endpoint
    * Resolution: Focus on One Visualization
* Scheduling conflicts: With busy schedules, we each had difficulties with scheduling time to meet to discuss the project
    * Resolution: Kept Open Communication
* Use of GitHub: Had a difficult time keeping track of branches and merge conflicts
    * Resolution: Communication & Teamwork

Possible Future Work Directions:
* Add more visualizations
* More options for users to group agencies
* Undergo user testing to gage usability and revise based on feedback
* Add more accessibility features
