        <h4>Mission Statement</h4>
            <p ALIGN=center>Our system aims to solve Prince George's county budget accessibility problem by providing data visualizations that the average taxpayer would be able to comprehend. 
            Datasets available to the public are currently set up to provide information on each transaction paid out to an agency, making it difficult to find 
            the total amount each agency received each year. To make these datasets easier to view, simply enter in an agency you are interested in into the search bar
        to view the visualization.</p>

        <p>As taxpayers to Prince George’s County, citizens have the right to know what agencies their money is going to and how much is being allocated to each one. While this data is publicly available online, it is anything but accessible. In its current form, someone interested in this information would have to download the data themselves and do their own analysis in order to find the total amount of money given to each agency. Simply, the current method of finding how much each agency is receiving from Prince George’s County is exceedingly difficult for the average person.
        </p>
        <p>Our website is geared toward adults who pay taxes in Prince George’s County. We decided on adult taxpayers specifically because while some teenagers and people in their 20’s pay taxes, we felt that they would not be as interested in this type of project compared to adults. Again, since these people are paying taxes to Prince George’s County, they have the right to know exactly where their money is being spent.</p>
