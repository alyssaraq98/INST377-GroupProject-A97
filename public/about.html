        <h4>Mission Statement</h4>
            <p>Our system aims to solve Prince George's county budget accessibility problem, by providing data visualizations that the average taxpayer would be able to comprehend. 
            Datasets available to the public are currently set up to provide information on each transaction paid out to an agency, making it difficult to find 
            the total amount each agency received each year. To make these datasets easier to view, simply enter in an agency you are interested in into the search bar
        to view the visualization.</p>
